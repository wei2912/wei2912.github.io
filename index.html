<h2 id="summary-pieces">Summary Pieces</h2>
<p>These articles are summary pieces on a few select topics, intended to let people dip
their toes into unfamiliar technical topics without sacrificing too much rigour.</p>
<h3 id="regularisation-redundancy-examining-generalisation-in-deep-learning">Regularisation &amp; Redundancy: Examining Generalisation in Deep Learning</h3>
<p>(WIP) A brief look into recent research on generalisation in deep learning, which runs
contrary to classical learning theory and common intuition. Rather than explain existing
theories of generalisation, which at present are still very diverse and complex, this
seeks to examine recent findings and the implications they have for the field.</p>
<h3 id="why-aes-is-secure"><a href="./posts/crypto/why-aes-is-secure.html">Why AES is Secure</a></h3>
<p>(January 1, 2017) An explanation of how AES, a commonly used modern crytosystem, was
designed to be resistant to many different types of cryptographic attacks.</p>
<h2 id="miscellaneous-pieces">Miscellaneous Pieces</h2>
<h3 id="introduction-to-haskell"><a href="./posts/haskell/intro-to-haskell.html">Introduction to Haskell</a></h3>
<p>(November 27, 2014) A brief introduction to Haskell, for programmers wondering
what functional programming languages have to offer over imperative languages.</p>

<p>The design of this blog was intended to be minimalist, while being very
readable and following responsive design principles. The general look and feel
of the blog is inspired by <a href="https://bost.ocks.org/mike">Mike Bostock</a>’s
website.</p>
<p>The website is hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> and I used these
software to build the website:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll">Hakyll</a>, a static site generator written in
Haskell which allows for great flexibility in the building of pages</li>
<li><a href="https://katex.org">KaTeX</a>, a renderer for <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a>
math equations</li>
<li><a href="https://utteranc.es/">Utterances</a>, a lightweight comments widget built on
GitHub issues</li>
</ul>
