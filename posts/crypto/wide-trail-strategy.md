In 2015, I wrote [an article](why-aes-is-secure) on the [Advanced Encryption
Standard (AES)][advanced-encryption-standard] which sought to provide some
intuition on the security of AES, one of the most widely used ciphers in modern
cryptography. While it provided a broad overview of various theoretical attacks,
I did not find its explanations satisfying as they were unable to reveal insight
into why and how AES was designed. This post is my attempt at breaking down the
complexities of `
