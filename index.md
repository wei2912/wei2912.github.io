<small>
The design of this blog was intended to be minimalist, while being very
readable and following responsive design principles. The general look and feel
of the blog is inspired by [Mike Bostock](https://bost.ocks.org/mike)'s
website.

The website is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) with
[Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) as a Content Delivery Network (CDN),
and I used these software to build the website:

- [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll), a static site generator written in
  Haskell which allows for great flexibility in the building of pages
- [KaTeX](https://katex.org) for [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) math
  equations
- [Utterances](https://utteranc.es/), a lightweight comments widget built on
  GitHub issues
