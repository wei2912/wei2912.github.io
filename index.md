<small>
The design of this blog was intended to be minimalist, while being very
readable and following responsive design principles. The general look and feel
of the blog is inspired by [Mike Bostock](https://bost.ocks.org/mike)'s
website.

I used these software to build the website:

* [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll), a static site generator written in
Haskell which allows for great flexibility in the building of pages
* [KaTeX](https://katex.org) for [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) math
equations
* [Utterances](https://utteranc.es/), a lightweight comments widget built on
GitHub issues

In addition to the above, I use these external services:

* [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com) serves DNS requests as well as all
of the content for [weien.io](https://weien.io)
